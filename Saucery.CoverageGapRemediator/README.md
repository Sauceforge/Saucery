# Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator

`Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator` consumes discrepancies emitted by `Saucery.CoverageGapReporter` and synthesizes repository changes from Saucery's existing platform implementation patterns.

## Design

There are no `ChromiumOsMissingStrategy`, `IosExactMissingStrategy`, `Android18Strategy`, or other platform/version-specific remediation classes.

The remediator:

1. scans `Saucery.Core` and `Saucery.Core.Tests`;
2. discovers platform products, creators, browser creators, factory/lookup registrations, helper methods and representative test registrations;
3. chooses the closest structural analogue for each discrepancy;
4. clones and transforms the analogue's implementation slice;
5. syntax-checks every generated C# file with Roslyn;
6. builds `Saucery.Core`;
7. runs `Saucery.Core.Tests`;
8. reruns `Saucery.CoverageGapReporter`;
9. repeats synthesis for any targeted discrepancy that remains, up to `--max-repair-passes`;
10. rolls the entire transaction back if build/test validation fails or the discrepancy cannot be eliminated.

This means future Android/iOS/macOS/Windows versions and new platform families are not selected through a predefined strategy table. The engine attempts to infer them from the repository it is actually modifying.

## Central Package Management

The project uses the repository's Central Package Management. `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces` has no version in this `.csproj`; its version belongs in the repository root `Directory.Packages.props`.

```xml
<PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces" Version="5.9.0" />
```

## Plan only

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator -- `
  --repo-root . `
  --report saucery-functional-platform-coverage-gaps.txt
```

## Apply

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator -- `
  --repo-root . `
  --report saucery-functional-platform-coverage-gaps.txt `
  --apply
```

Obsolete-candidate deletion remains opt-in because the reporter deliberately calls these *candidates* and Sauce API/catalogue disagreement has occurred before:

```powershell
--allow-obsolete-removal
```


Validation builds both Core projects and verifies the discrepancy with CoverageGapReporter. Runtime test failures caused by the live Sauce Labs acquisition hook are reported as inconclusive rather than as remediation failures.


## Multiple test suites

The remediator discovers every top-level `Saucery.Core.Tests*` project and treats it as a first-class test surface. This includes both:

- `Saucery.Core.Tests` (TUnit)
- `Saucery.Core.Tests,XUnit3` (xUnit.v3)

When a platform remediation is inferred from an existing analogue, equivalent test registrations/data are transformed in every discovered test suite. Validation builds and runs every discovered test project.


## Obsolete removal safety

Obsolete remediation removes matching registrations first and never line-edits owned platform/creator class declarations. Product/creator files are deleted only when no surviving source or test project references their declared symbols. Shared platform slices, such as an exact simulator version whose major real-device family is still supported, remain intact.


## Obsolete platform remediation

Obsolete removal is deterministic and does not use nearest-version inference.

The discrepancy is converted directly to the expected implementation type. Examples:

- `iOS 13.x` -> `IOS13Platform` and `IOS13PlatformCreator`
- `Windows 8` -> `Windows8Platform` and `Windows8PlatformCreator`
- `Windows 8.1` -> `Windows81Platform` and `Windows81PlatformCreator`

The remediator locates the exact class declarations under `ConcreteProducts` and `ConcreteCreators`, deletes those files, and then removes only source lines that contain an exact C# identifier reference to one of those deleted types and remain syntactically valid after removal.

It does not fuzzy-match version names, constants, browser names, resolutions, or unrelated platform text. The normal build/validation stage is the final safety gate.
