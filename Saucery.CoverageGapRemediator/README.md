# Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator

`Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator` consumes discrepancies emitted by `Saucery.CoverageGapReporter` and synthesizes repository changes from Saucery's existing platform implementation patterns.

## Design

There are no `ChromiumOsMissingStrategy`, `IosExactMissingStrategy`, `Android18Strategy`, or other platform/version-specific remediation classes.

The remediator:

1. scans `Saucery.Core` and `Saucery.Core.Tests`;
2. discovers platform products, creators, browser creators, factory/lookup registrations, helper methods and representative test registrations;
3. chooses the closest structural analogue for each discrepancy;
4. clones and transforms the analogue's implementation slice;
5. syntax-checks every generated C# file with Roslyn;
6. builds `Saucery.Core`;
7. runs `Saucery.Core.Tests`;
8. reruns `Saucery.CoverageGapReporter`;
9. repeats synthesis for any targeted discrepancy that remains, up to `--max-repair-passes`;
10. rolls the entire transaction back if build/test validation fails or the discrepancy cannot be eliminated.

This means future Android/iOS/macOS/Windows versions and new platform families are not selected through a predefined strategy table. The engine attempts to infer them from the repository it is actually modifying.

## Central Package Management

The project uses the repository's Central Package Management. `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces` has no version in this `.csproj`; its version belongs in the repository root `Directory.Packages.props`.

```xml
<PackageVersion Include="Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Workspaces" Version="5.9.0" />
```

## Plan only

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator -- `
  --repo-root . `
  --report saucery-functional-platform-coverage-gaps.txt
```

## Apply

```powershell
dotnet run -c Release --project Saucery.CoverageGapRemediator -- `
  --repo-root . `
  --report saucery-functional-platform-coverage-gaps.txt `
  --apply
```

Obsolete-candidate deletion remains opt-in because the reporter deliberately calls these *candidates* and Sauce API/catalogue disagreement has occurred before:

```powershell
--allow-obsolete-removal
```
